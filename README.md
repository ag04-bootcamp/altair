# altair

So, what is the **altair** you may ask...

Altair is a web application that allows users to take care of their health.
Users can enter their profile,
keep the record of their measurements (eg. temperature, pressure) and a lot more.

Our dedicated team spent many months brainstorming about best technology stack for this magnificent app.
And we decided to use **Kotlin** as a language of choice for backend, backed up with
**Spring Boot** framework and with help of **Flux** rest api we started our jurney.

Regarding frontend, we delegated the best developers to think about tech stack.
Language of choice was **JavaScript**, because it is the best, not because it is the only one.
**React** to take care of this complex reactive interface.

We like to see healthy people around us,
and with **altair**, you can be healthy too!
